=item store_sequence

This stores a bioperl sequence object, if optional second argument is true we
won't store the raw sequence string (because it would be too long). Returns
the newly created dao Seq object.

=item store_feature

This populate the CDS and RNA features, taking care with remotely accessioned features.
NB! Bioperl feature->spliced_seq will just return a guess at the length of the sequence, padded with 'N's
when the acc number is remote. This is often a bad guess because it is based on the presumption that the
ENTIRE feature is remote, when often just a piece of the feature is remote. Go ahead, look at the code...
if( !defined $called_seq ) {
	$seqstr .= 'N' x $self->length;  ...here the length is for the feature's location, not the features sublocation
	next; ...so for something like join(BC123.1:1-100, 12-200,10000-10100) it might be 10100 minus 12.
DO NOT USE feat->length for split sequences at all! unless you want the length of the whole region from min to max.

=item run_blast_search

This runs a local BLAST search. We initially assume we run the search against
the InParanoid data base, which is defined in the config object, and that
we run a protein blast, i.e. 'blastp'. The method needs a -seq => $seq argument,
which can either be a Seq object, or a raw string such as is produced by
get_aa_for_sequence. What we get back is the following: every BLAST hit will
have a sequence ID for which multiple InParanoid records exist, because that
sequence has been blasted against 99 other genomes, so the return value is
an array of result sets.

If we are comparing two root clusters, and for each of those we get the seed_gi,
we need to then get the amino acid translation for that, BLAST it against the
database, and then in the first result set, there has to be a combination of
results, i.e. InParanoid objects, for which $r1->is_orthologous($r2) is true.

=head1 NAME

Bio::Phylo::PhyLoTA::Service::SequenceGetter - Sequence Getter

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This fetches the smallest containing cluster for a provided gi from phylota, computes the median sequence
length to filter out duplicates, and align the sequences with a bioperl wrapper for muscle.
