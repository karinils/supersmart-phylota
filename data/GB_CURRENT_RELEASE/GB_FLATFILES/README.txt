This directory will hold the "current" release of the GenBank sequence files of
interest (e.g. only animals, plants and fungi, no ESTs, etc.). The current
release is whatever the release number is in ../GB_Release_Number. When the
files are downloaded (e.g. by a "make" target), the download date is written
to the file ../GB_Release_Number_Date.
