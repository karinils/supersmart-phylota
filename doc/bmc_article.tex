%% Background %%
%%
\section*{Background}
% here we describe what phylota is as well as the need for a programming interface
The Background section should be written in a way that is accessible to researchers 
without specialist knowledge in that area and must clearly state - and, if helpful, 
illustrate - the background to the research and its aims. It should clearly described 
the relevant context and the specific issue which the software described is intended to 
address.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Implementation %%
%%
\section*{Implementation}
This should include a description of the overall architecture of the software 
implementation, along with details of any critical issues and how they were addressed.

  \subsection*{Design}
  % here we describe the basic design of the classes, i.e. the DAO and Service layer
  Text for this section \ldots

  \subsection*{Installation}
  % how to install, environment variable PHYLOTA_HOME, the config file, the make file,
  % replicating the database, dependencies
  Text for this section \ldots

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Results and Discussion %%
%%
\section*{Results and Discussion}
The Results and Discussion may be combined into a single section or presented separately. 
They may also be broken into subsections with short, informative headings. In any case 
what should be described is the functionality of the software together with data on how 
its performance and functionality compare with and improve on functionally similar 
existing software. There should then be a discussion of the intended use of the software, 
and the benefits that are envisioned together, if possible, with an outline for the 
planned future development of new features.

  \subsection*{Usage examples}
  % here we have some brief code samples that demonstrate the utility of the API
  Text for this section \ldots
